[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ssh_scan.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ssh_scan)

A SSH configuration and policy scanner

## Key Benefits

- **Minimal Dependencies** - Uses native Ruby and BinData to do its work, no heavy dependencies.
- **Not Just a Script** - Implementation is portable for use in another project or for automation of tasks.
- **Simple** - Just point `ssh_scan` at an SSH service and get a JSON report of what it supports and its policy status.
- **Configurable** - Make your own custom policies that fit your unique policy requirements.

## Setup

To install and run as a gem, type:

```bash
gem install ssh_scan
ssh_scan
```

To run from a docker container, type:

```bash
docker pull mozilla/ssh_scan
docker run -it --rm mozilla/ssh_scan /app/bin/ssh_scan -t sshscan.rubidus.com
```

To install and run from source, type:

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/ssh_scan.git
cd ssh_scan

gem install bundler
bundle install

./bin/ssh_scan
```
